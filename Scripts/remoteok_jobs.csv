With Tinybird, you can effortlessly ingest multiple data sources at scale, query and shape it using the 100% pure SQL you already know and love, and publish results as low-latency, high-concurrency APIs for your applications to chirp about. Developers can create fast APIs, fasterâwhat used to take hours and days now only takes minutes! Tinybird is the essential tool that data engineers and software developers have been waiting for enabling you to drive innovation with ease.</p>\n<p></p><p><br></p><b>What you will be doing: We are looking for someone to help us scale and to keep our software and infrastructure reliable and elastic as we scale.

We try to keep things simple. Technologies we use:</li><li>OpenResty: SSL termination and load balancing</li><li>Varnish: load balancing and, sometimes, caching</li><li>Redis: metadata store</li><li>Python: most of our backend uses Python except some small bits that rely on C++ for hot paths</li><li>ClickHouse: our main data store</li><li>Zookeeper: for ClickHouse replicas coordination</li><li>We use Grafana, Loki and Mimir for monitoring and alerting</li><li>Terraform: Cloud provisioning (virtual machines, networks, Kubernetes clusters)</li><li>Ansible: Deploys and software and config provisioning</li><li>Our number of machines is still manageable, but the number keeps growing as we keep adding customers. This is not about managing infrastructure but about making sure that our software uses the hardware resources wisely and flexibly.

This requires good knowledge of storage, networking, and computing</li><li>Disaster recovery: improving our tooling to manage and discover problems, but also improving our on-call procedures</li><li>As a specific challenge: when our customers grow, we need to upgrade their accounts. Now, we do it manuallyânot in the traditional sense of manual because we have tools that automate much of the process, but we need to take care of that one customer at a time: deciding what machines we need to spin-up, how much compute capacity we will provision, etc. Ideally, our architecture should allow our customers to upgrade themselves and assign more resources to them dynamically and seamlessly in the most dynamic, safe and transparent way possible.</li></ul><p><br></p><b>What you bring:</b><ul><li>Experience designing, building and running distributed Cloud architectures and large scale web based applications.

At Tinybird, we work mostly with Python and C++</li><li>Accountable and enthusiastic to take on the responsibility of designing and managing the platform, and an urge to take on things that may be broken. Unafraid to break stuff because you own it and can fix it if need be.</li><li>Bias for action, iteration and delivery. Conscious that often decisions can be reversed quickly and that speed is of the essence in business and technology</li><li>That you think in terms of systems and you are attuned to edge cases, failure modes, behaviors, specific implementations</li><li>Comfortable collaborating and communicating asynchronously, but expect direct communication within the team on a daily basis</li><li>Build software with empathy, ensuring it's intuitive and maintainable. Document key insights and solutions to make it easy for everyone to understand and use without needing extensive documentation</li><li>Experience with OpenResty, Varnish, Redis, Terraform or Ansible would be great for you to get up and running quickly, but we donât bring you here to tell you what the right technologies are: rather we expect you to recommend the right one for each challenge</li><li>Experience with ClickHouse and/or rolling out database systems at scale would be a huge plus.</li></ul><div><br></div><p><br></p><p></p>\n<div>â¬62,000 - â¬109,000 a year</div><small><div>This role includes both cash compensation and a stock options grant.

Industry giants like Adobe and IBM trust our courses to train their teams, and prestigious universities such as MIT and the University of Cambridge use our materials in their curricula.</p><p>Weâve assembled anÂ <strong>exceptional team of unicorns</strong>Â who support, inspire, and challenge each other every day. We wake up each morning excited to build a brighter future for millions of people around the world.</p><p>But somethingâs missing. And we thinkÂ <strong>it could be you</strong>.</p><p>This is a role for someone who can âwalk the talk.â Weâre not looking for a self-proclaimed âbrand ninjaâ or âmarketing rockstar.â We want aÂ <strong>builder,Â </strong>someone who knows how to get things done, shows proof, not pitch, and lives for measurable outcomes.</p><h2><strong>Do You Share the Vision of IxDF?</strong></h2><p>People donât just buy our courses; they invest in a better version of themselves. Thatâs why every campaign and content piece we create must do more than âmarket.â It must reflect what we believe in as a brand:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Show the dream outcome:</strong>Â Help people imagine a future of creative, meaningful work, freedom, fulfillment, flexibility, and impact through great design.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strengthen belief in success:</strong>Â Build confidence through real stories, practical roadmaps, and expert-led guidance. People should feel, âIf they did it, I can too.â</p></li><li><p><strong>Speed up the time to value:</strong>Â Offer instant wins. Make progress feel close and tangible not someday, but now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lower the effort barrier:</strong>Â Make it feel doable. No jargon. No overwhelm. Just human, beginner-friendly, bite-sized steps that meet people where they are.</p></li></ul><p>Your job would be to translate this into headlines, hooks, content pieces, social media posts, campaigns, and data-informed strategy. Youâll create clarity, motivation, and momentum with a dash of unicorn magic.</p><h2><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></h2><p>Youâll be at the core of our growth engine, running and optimizing the systems that bring learners into our ecosystem. You will:</p><ul><li><p>Create, own and scaleÂ <strong>organic content</strong>Â that earns attention, builds trust, and drives long-term growth across platforms.</p></li><li><p>Plan and executeÂ <strong>high-impact campaigns</strong>Â for events like Black Friday, New Year, Unicorn Day, and Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Youâll turn briefs into successful results and reports into actionable insights.</p></li><li><p>Experiment withÂ <strong>new channels</strong>Â like TikTok, Reddit, YouTube Shortsâlaunching quick pilots and scaling what works.</p></li><li><p>Build and maintain clear,Â <strong>concise documentation</strong>Â and reporting dashboards to make campaign operations more transparent, repeatable, and effective.</p></li><li><p>UseÂ <strong>analytics to learn and iterate</strong>, not just report. Your campaigns get smarter every time.</p></li><li><p>Champion our value propositionâbe aÂ <strong>brand ambassador</strong>Â for our mission, bringing our voice, vision, and values to life across every touchpoint.</p></li><li><p>Run and scaleÂ <strong>paid media</strong>Â on Meta, Google, LinkedIn, and YouTube. From targeting to copywriting to ROAS trackingâyouâll own it all.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>About you</strong></h2><p>Youâre an optimizer, a problem-solver, and a builder. More specifically:</p><ul><li><p>You bringÂ <strong>storytelling and creativity</strong>Â to your work and can craft organic content that captures attention and connects with users.</p></li><li><p>You have a sixth sense for micro-copy, and the know-how toÂ <strong>write</strong>Â <strong>persuasive, on-brand copy</strong>Â that drives action.</p></li><li><p>You haveÂ <strong>experience with</strong>Â <strong>launching</strong>Â <strong>campaigns</strong>Â across owned and paid platforms and have the track record to show it.</p></li><li><p>You areÂ <strong>comfortable with platforms</strong>Â like Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, and LinkedIn Campaign Manager, and you understand their constraints and superpowers.</p></li><li><p>You donât just launch ads, youÂ <strong>improve everything around them</strong>: the copy, the images, the funnel, the flow, the analytics.</p></li><li><p>Youâre driven byÂ <strong>impact and fluent in data</strong>Â - you use metrics to uncover insights, guide decisions, and optimize performance. But you also understand human behavior, platform psychology, and what makes a message truly land.</p></li><li><p>You view AI not as a threat or a substitution for that infamous human touch but as aÂ <strong>force multiplier of your human capabilities</strong>. You use AI to build faster, smarter, and better results.</p></li><li><p>You have aÂ <strong>keen eye for content</strong>, and you can quickly understand what type of content is meaningful, appropriate and useful in each situation or each platform.</p></li><li><p>You areÂ <strong>fluent in written English</strong>Â with exceptional writing skills, grammar and an appreciation for the power of tone, brevity and microscopy.</p></li><li><p>You areÂ <strong>based within the UTC -1 to UTC +3 time zone,</strong>Â which is crucial to ensure optimal collaboration and overlapping working hours.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Bonus points</strong></h2><p>You stand out if you...</p><ul><li><p>Have experience creating or managingÂ <strong>video-centric campaigns</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Know your way aroundÂ <strong>GA4, GTM, and server-side tagging</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>What We Can Offer</strong></h2><ul><li><p>AÂ <strong>full-time position</strong>, within a fully remote organization.

Itâll be yours too.</p></li><li><p>A companyÂ <strong>where the distance between idea and execution is minimal.Â </strong>Weâre a highly agile organization withÂ <strong>zero bureaucracy or corporate politics</strong>Â â and withÂ <strong>exceptional order and efficiency</strong>.</p></li><li><p>A company culture where<strong>Â passion meets high performance and excellence</strong>.

Hereâs what it means to me and Zen:</p><p>â¢ Valuing real world outcomes and shared learning over output</p><p>â¢ Product thinking over pure tech - start with the problem, ship quickly and iterate.&nbsp;</p><p>â¢ Team success and sustainability over individual heroics.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We are a small, but mighty team and so every engineer has the opportunity to make an outsized impact and put their stamp on what excellence looks like in practice.

I also </i><b><i>upgraded our backend Rails app</i></b><i> to use latest version of Ruby, Sidekiq, Rack and Pumaâ</i> - Adrian</p><p><br></p><p><i>âI started the week by </i><b><i>pushing some small updates to our React Native app</i></b><i>, and then finished the week by shipping a feature to improve the experience of schools finding teachers and managing to </i><b><i>clean up a bunch of legacy code</i></b><i> in the process.</i>â - Chris</p><p><br></p><p><i>âI explored the feasibility of </i><b><i>using Google Document AI to extract data</i></b><i> from documents uploaded by candidates and validate them, improving automation for our onboarding process""</i> - Lucas</p><p><br></p><p><i>âI implemented backend and frontend </i><b><i>MixPanel events for crucial workflows</i></b><i> to better understand how users interact with our product and what we can improve on.""</i> - Georgi</p><p><br></p><p><i>âI spent some time </i><b><i>monitoring Sentry</i></b><i> to spot performance trends and debug issues. I also </i><b><i>built an automated rota in Coda</i></b><i> for our Native release process, before reviewing Product Refinement Docs and contributing to </i><b><i>shaping the solutions</i></b><i>.â</i> - Ethan</p><p><br></p><p><b style=""font-size: 24px;"">What you might like or dislike</b><span style=""font-size: 24px;"">&nbsp;</span></p><p>Every place makes tradeoffs based on what they value and where they are in their journey âï¸. Hereâs a list of things you might find useful in figuring out if this is the right role for you. If we end up chatting, feel free to dig deeper into any of them. Note that some of these are recent changes in our approach and may be âwork in progressâ when you join.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">ð» </span><b style=""font-size: 18px;"">How We Work</b></p><p>â¢ <b>Boring tech for the obvious, experimentation for the rest.</b> Our core is Ruby on Rails, React, React Native, running on Heroku + Cloudflare etc.&nbsp; But we have also evaluated Amazon Personalise as a candidate for our matching system and spiked out our own AI powered knowledge-base.&nbsp;</p><p>â¢ <b>Process serves performance.</b> We use agile sprints and other structure to support, but our focus is on outcomes not following rules. Greater performance gives greater freedom - think âMaster your instrument, master the music, and then forget all that and just play.â</p><p>â¢ <b>Engineers as problem shapers (not ticket takers).</b> Youâll thrive here if you want to shape problems, not just deliver tickets. Our Product Managers and Designers are partners you pull on for leverage rather than task givers who hide the users away.</p><p>â¢ <b>Daily shipping culture</b>. We ship regularly and want to get even better at it. We are investing in this and welcome those whoâll help us start smaller and iterate faster.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">ð± </span><b style=""font-size: 18px;"">Growth &amp; Progression</b></p><p>â¢ <b>Choose your own career path.</b> We care more about impact and learning than rigid competency grids. This means greater flexibility in what progression looks like, but requires you to build an understanding of what we value from guiding principles and shared real-world examples.</p><p>â¢ <b>Few Titles, infinite Levels.</b> We use Levels instead of Titles to show growth in a Role. You wonât see titles like Associate, Senior, or Staff here. Instead, you can grow continuously by getting better at your current role - e.g. working faster, safer, and more independently. Changing roles is possible too, but depends on business needs, since different roles aim for different business outcomes and typically use different skills.</p><p>â¢ <b>Investment over reward as a mindset.</b> Level changes are tightly coupled to compensation changes. Confidence in a Level change is based on sustainably doing great work at <i>your current level.</i> We think it is fairer to invest in what you do next, rather than reward you doing the next Level first for free!</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">ð¸ </span><b style=""font-size: 18px;"">Compensation</b></p><p>â¢ <b>Market reality.</b> Compensation is based on your competitiveness in your local hiring market (note thatâs not just where you live). We donât believe anyone has found a great solution to global compensation, so we aim instead to be clear and equitable in how we do it.</p><p>â¢ <b>Solid, but not flashy compensation</b>. We pay decently, but we wonât beat out companies with deeper pockets (yet!).</p><p>â¢ <b>Think long term investment</b>. If you are in a place where you need to prioritise immediate financial gain then this probably isnât the right time to join us.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">ð¤</span><b style=""font-size: 18px;""> Team Culture &amp; Collaboration</b></p><p>â¢ <b>Distributed engineering team</b>. Solid communication skills and async habits are key to be effective. Youâll find strong connection here, but not through engineering getting together in-person. If you like the buzz of working near others you are welcome to work from one of our offices, but there wonât be many engineers there on any given day.</p><p>â¢ <b>We believe in impact and measurable outcomes, alongside shared learning.</b> If your work moves the needle or teaches us something meaningful then thatâs a win. If not, then weâll want to understand why.&nbsp;</p><p>â¢ <b>Balanced, sustainable work. Long hours are not a badge of honour</b> - they are an indication something isnât working well. We value a sustainable pace and healthy teams.</p><p>â¢ <b>Diversity is good in some ways and lacking in others. </b>You might be the first of something here. That matters and weâll support appropriately if you are.</p><p><br></p><p><b style=""font-size: 24px;"">How we hire</b></p><p><b>Hire fast, fix fast.</b>&nbsp; Hiring today is...not great, with most companies being too cautious and taking too long to make a decision ð¦. We move quicker - our ideal is: apply Monday, offer by Friday. Then we invest heavily in the most important part - your onboarding. We ensure you are setup for success, with clear direction, experience of different teams and shipping to production within days.</p><p><br></p><p>Whilst fast doesnât mean frivolous, it does slightly increase the risk that you or we made a mistake. So we include regular check-ins during onboarding to make sure expectations match reality. If either side feels something is off then we try to fix it fast. And sometimes that will mean saying âletâs not carry onâ with respect.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Real talk. </b>We believe in being direct and authentic. Weâll share the good, the messy and the challenges. We recognise we wonât have all the answers, still have much to learn, and thatâs all part of the fun of this wild ride ð. We expect the same from you - after all we are just a bunch of humans trying to do great work together.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Mindset, not tools.</b> We hire for how you think and create leverage, not what specific tools youâve used before. To us, experience is just another tool - it is only valuable through how you leverage it. Curiosity, adaptability, product thinking - those are the durable qualities in a changing world. And we value different opinions, so ensure you share yours - have a point of view, maybe debate a little and we will respect that.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Always open to great people.</b> We are always hiring and happy to chat even if the timing isnât quite right. Thatâs why you might see this job post open for a long time. We are not collecting resumes or doing stealth market research, we just believe in the power of serendipity. To make that more transparent - right now we have a clear need for <b>at least 2</b> more engineers in the team.</p><p><br></p><p><b style=""font-size: 18px;"">Okay, so what will the actual process look like?</b><span style=""font-size: 18px;""> ð</span></p><p>â¢ <b>Recruiter quick chat. </b>Our recruiter will check you are human, can communicate effectively and cover some of the basics like compensation, benefits and availability.</p><p>â¢ <b>Technical expertise.</b> We will do a paired session with a twist - we will be the ones sharing our screen and writing the code. So come prepared to ask questions, drive progress with another engineer and dig through an ambiguous past problem in our codebase.</p><p>â¢ <b>Product thinking. </b>Chat to either our CPTO or a Product Manager about how youâve demonstrated a product mindset in the past. Or if you havenât had opportunity to do that, tell us why and what youâd do differently with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>â¢ <b>Role chat.</b> This will be with me and Iâll be wanting to understand how you think and approach the role and engineering excellence. Iâll start by asking you the question you include in your application. And Iâll want to dig into your answers so that this becomes more of a conversation and shared exploration than a Q&amp;A session ð.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>After the recruiter chat, the remaining sessions can happen in any order and as quickly as our schedules can align. You could do them all in a day if you want or spread them out a bit.</p><p><br></p><p>Once interviewers have shared their feedback from each session we do an internal debrief - thatâs where we discuss what we are excited about you for in the role, any challenges we see and whether we think we can mitigate them at this time. From there we will make a decision and either proceed to offer or tell you that we not offering.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We believe feedback is important, but also know not everyone wants it - so we donât share it by default. If youâd like feedback after the process, just let us know. Note that weâll frame the feedback from our perspective of why we did or did not have the confidence rather than as a commentary on you.</p><p><br></p><p><b style=""font-size: 24px;"">Interested? Letâs go!</b></p><p>If you read all of the above and are excited (maybe even a little nervous) about the opportunity and how we work then I recommend applying now! If you skipped or skimmed the above, feel free to apply anyway but youâre missing a bunch of useful information that could streamline the process for you ð</p>\n<p></p><p><br></p><p></p>\n<br/><br/>Please mention the word **CREATIVE** and tag RMzguNjguMTM0LjE5NA== when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMzguNjguMTM0LjE5NA==).
